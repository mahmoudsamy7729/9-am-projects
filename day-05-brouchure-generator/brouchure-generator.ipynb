I like writing code and experimenting with LLMs, and hopefully you’re here because you do too. I also enjoy amateur electronic music production (\\nvery\\namateur) and losing myself in\\nHacker News\\n, nodding my head sagely to things I only half understand.\\nI’m the co-founder and CTO of\\nNebula.io\\n. We’re applying AI to a field where it can make a massive, positive impact: helping people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being. I’m previously the founder and CEO of AI startup untapt,\\nacquired in 2021\\n.\\nI will happily drone on for hours about LLMs to anyone in my vicinity. My friends got fed up with my impromptu lectures, and convinced me to make some Udemy courses. To my total joy (and shock) they’ve become best-selling, top-rated courses, with 400,000 enrolled across 190 countries. The\\nfull curriculum is here\\n. If you’re visiting from one of my courses – I’m super grateful!\\nKeep in touch\\nI’ll only ever contact you occasionally, and\\nI’ll always aim to add value with every email.\\nThank you!\\nI’ll keep you posted.\\nEnter your email…\\nWarning\\nStay in touch\\nSubmitting form\\nΔ\\nJanuary 4, 2026\\nAI Builder with n8n – Create Agents and Voice Agents\\nNovember 11, 2025\\nThe Unique Energy of an AI Live Event\\nSeptember 15, 2025\\nAI Engineering MLOps Track – Deploy AI to Production\\nMay 28, 2025\\nWhich order to take the AI courses?\\nNavigation\\nHome\\nAI Curriculum\\nProficient AI Engineer\\nConnect Four\\nOutsmart\\nAn arena that pits LLMs against each other in a battle of diplomacy and deviousness\\nAbout\\nPosts\\nGet in touch\\ned [at] edwarddonner [dot] com\\nwww.edwarddonner.com\\nFollow me\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nSubscribe to newsletter\\nType your email…\\nSubscribe\\n## Relevant Links:\\n\\n\\n### Link: about page\\nAbout - Edward Donner\\n\\nHome\\nAI Curriculum\\nProficient AI Engineer\\nConnect Four\\nOutsmart\\nAn arena that pits LLMs against each other in a battle of diplomacy and deviousness\\nAbout\\nPosts\\nAbout\\nI’m the co-founder and CTO of\\nNebula.io\\n. We help recruiters source, understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI and other forms of machine learning. Our\\npatented\\nmodel matches people with roles with greater accuracy and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required. Take a look for yourself; it’s completely free to try.\\nOur long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being, motivated by a concept called\\nIkigai\\n. We help people find roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people don’t consider themselves\\ninspired or engaged\\nat work, it’s completely within our reach.\\nI sometimes have to pinch myself. I’m incredibly lucky to be working in the field of AI at a time when it’s rewriting the boundaries of human and tech possibilities. I’m personally most drawn to applying AI to real world problems, and the specific problem of hiring has plagued me throughout my career. So I’m in the business of finding people their dream jobs — and conveniently, I’m in my dream job myself.\\nAI Speaker\\nI have a bad habit of lecturing all my friends on everything that astonishes me about LLMs and Agents. They convinced me to\\nmake Udemy courses\\n, probably so I’d leave them alone. Somehow 400,000 people are now on the courses. It’s been the greatest joy!\\nI also run\\nLive Events for O’Reilly and Pearson\\nwhich are super fun. It’s the closest thing a nerd like me will get to being a Twitch star! And, Jon Krohn and I gave a talk on Agents at ODSC in Boston that’s been viewed 180k times. I love making these and I’m so grateful that people watch them.\\nBefore Nebula.io\\nYou can trace the roots of Nebula.io to an AI startup I founded in 2013 c\\n\\n### Link: blog/posts page\\n429 Too Many Requests\\n\\n429 Too Many Requests\\nYou have been rate-limited for making too many requests in a short time frame.\\nWebsite owner?

It’s brought me much joy to share my enthusiasm for the world of LLMs. I never expected this, but 400,000 people are taking the courses from 190 countries. It’s bewildering and I’m super grateful.\\nI get this question a lot: in what order should the courses be taken? Here’s my definitive answer with the curriculum for becoming an AI expert.\\nThe complete curriculum\\nTitle\\nAudience\\nIncludes\\nLink + Coupon\\nAI Builder\\nwith n8n\\nEveryone: tech and non-tech\\nAgents & Voice Agents\\nLink\\nAI Leader\\n: deliver business value\\nEveryone: tech and non-tech\\nDelivering value with AI\\nLink\\nAI Engineer\\n: Core Track\\nTech and aspiring tech\\nLLMs, RAG, Fine-tuning, Agents\\nLink\\nAI Engineer\\n: Agentic Track\\nTech and aspiring tech\\nAgent Loops, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP\\nLink\\nAI Engineer\\n: MLOps Track\\nTech\\nVercel, AWS, GCP, Azure, LangFuse\\nLink\\nSidenote:\\nI updated some of these course names recently for clarity:\\nAI Engineer Core Track was previously “Master LLM Engineering”\\nAI Engineer Agentic Track was previously “Agentic AI”\\nAI Engineer MLOps Track was previously “AI in Production”\\nWhich order to take the courses?\\nAll the courses are designed to be complementary and can be taken in any order. You should pick the order that most resonates with you. All things being equal, it might be most natural to follow the exact order in the table above; then each course will build on the last.\\nI looked at actual job descriptions for AI Engineering roles in designing this curriculum.
